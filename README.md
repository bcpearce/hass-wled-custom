# HASS WLED Custom

Repo for adding custom wled component that supports custom palettes.

This code is largely copied from https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/wled with manifest.json modified to comply with Custom Components requirements and select.py changed to allow updates of selection options for palettes.
